# Cpp

**This Code provides a solution to the diamond problem, a common issue in programming languages that support multiple inheritance like C++.
The diamond problem arises when a class inherits from two other classes that share a common ancestor, leading to ambiguity or conflicts in the derived class.**

*emp.h - This header file contains the class declarations for the Main class and its subclasses.*

*main.cpp -  This file contains the implementation of the Diamond Problem , which resolves the diamond problem using virtual inheritance*
